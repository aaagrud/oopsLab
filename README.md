# Object Oriented Programming Laboratory - 19-202-0308

## Course Outcomes:
1. Familiarise with the language environment.
2. Develop object-oriented programming style and compare that with structured style of programming.
3. Plan and decide appropriate OOP features for the problems in hand.
4. Create a complete class definition with constructors and methods and to instantiate it.
5. Design efficient programs by incorporating OOP features like operator overloading, virtual functions, different ways of inheritance structures, etc.
6. Develop programs that can read and write data to and from secondary storage.

## Cycle-I
1. Programs to differentiate between struct and class.
2. Programs to implement data abstraction, data encapsulation, and information hiding.
3. Programs to demonstrate parameter passing techniques.

### Experiments:
- Phone Numbers - [phoneNumber.cpp](phoneNumber.cpp)
- Date - [date.cpp](date.cpp)
- Bank - [bank.cpp](bank.cpp)
- Triangle - [shortDistance.cpp](shortDistance.cpp)

## Cycle-II
1. Programs to implement different Inheritance structures - Single, multiple, multilevel, and hierarchical.
2. Programs to implement Operator overloading and function overloading.
3. Programs to implement virtual functions and dynamic binding.

### Experiments:
- Power of Variables - [powerVariables.cpp](powerVariables.cpp)
- Swap Values - [swapValues.cpp](swapValues.cpp)
- Array - [arrayClass.cpp](arrayClass.cpp)
- Shortest Distance - [shortestDistance.cpp](shortestDistance.cpp)

## Cycle-III Part-I

### Experiments:

## Cycle-III Part-II

### Experiments:
